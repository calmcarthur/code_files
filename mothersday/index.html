                Hello Mother. <br> I hope you like the website I put together for you. It took longer than I care to admit.
                <br><br>
                Happy Mother's day to the best one out there. Though I cannot be with you today, <br>
                you are on my mind as I reflect on everything you do for me. Thank you for all your words of <br>
                encouragment, your endless support, and your valuable wisdom. <br><br>
                Thanks for being my role model throughout my 18 young years, and thanks in advance <br> 
                for being the one I will continue to look up to for the many more to come. <br>
                Thank you for making my life awesome, and thank you for being so awesome :). 
                <br><br>

                Love you lots and have the best day ever,
                <br><br>
